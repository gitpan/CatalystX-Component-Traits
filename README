NAME
    CatalystX::Component::Traits - Automatic Trait Loading and Resolution
    for Catalyst Components

SYNOPSIS
        package Catalyst::Model::SomeModel;
        with 'CatalystX::Component::Traits';

        package MyApp::Model::MyModel;
        use parent 'Catalyst::Model::SomeModel';

        package MyApp;

        __PACKAGE__->config('Model::MyModel' => {
            traits => ['SearchedForTrait', '+Fully::Qualified::Trait']
        });

DESCRIPTION
    Adds a "COMPONENT" in Catalyst::Component method to your Catalyst
    component base class that reads the optional "traits" parameter from app
    and component config and instantiates the component subclass with those
    traits using "new_with_traits" in MooseX::Traits from
    MooseX::Traits::Pluggable.

TRAIT SEARCH
    Trait names qualified with a "+" are taken to be full package names.

    Unqualified names are searched for, using the algorithm described below.

  EXAMPLE
    Suppose your inheritance hierarchy is:

        MyApp::Model::MyModel
        Catalyst::Model::CatModel
        Catalyst::Model
        Catalyst::Component
        Moose::Object

    The configuration is:

        traits => ['Foo']

    The package search order for "Foo" will be:

        MyApp::TraitFor::Model::CatModel::Foo
        Catalyst::TraitFor::Model::CatModel::Foo

  A MORE PATHOLOGICAL EXAMPLE
    For:

        My::App::Controller::AController
        CatalystX::Something::ControllerBase::SomeController
        Catalyst::Controller
        Catalyst::Model
        Catalyst::Component
        Moose::Object

    With:

        traits => ['Foo']

    Search order for "Foo" will be:

        My::App::TraitFor::Controller::SomeController::Foo
        CatalystX::Something::TraitFor::Controller::SomeController::Foo

    The "Base" after (M|V|C) is automatically removed.

TRAIT MERGING
    Traits from component class config and app config are automatically
    merged if you set the "_trait_merge" attribute default, e.g.:

        has '+_trait_merge' => (default => 1);

    You can remove component class config traits by prefixing their names
    with a "-" in the app config traits.

    For example:

        package Catalyst::Model::Foo;
        has '+_trait_merge' => (default => 1);
        __PACKAGE__->config->{traits} = [qw/Foo Bar/];

        package MyApp;
        __PACKAGE__->config->{'Model::Foo'}{traits} = [qw/-Foo Baz/];

    Will load the traits:

        Bar Baz
